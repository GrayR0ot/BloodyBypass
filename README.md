# BloodyMouse_Bypass

Since Rust a banned Core 3 of Bloody Mouse devices, you can't play while Core 3 is enabled!

I hate hackers, but when you play vs a hacker, you can't do anything... Care me about 20%+ of rust player's are running NoRecoil / Hacks
So I decided to make this Bypass public! You only have to compile it with your favorite IDE.

Specifications:
  - Hashed login
  - Undetectable
  - JavaFX Framework

Make sure having maven installed
Maven compile: mvn clean package assembly:single
